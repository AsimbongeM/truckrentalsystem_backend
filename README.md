**Purpose of the Repository**

The `truckrentalsystem_backend` repository is part of a truck rental website project. It uses Spring Boot and Spring Security for backend development and React for the frontend. The backend is responsible for handling the core business logic, data management, and API services, while the frontend manages the user interface and interactions.

**Features and Technologies**

The key features of this project include:
1. **Manager Operations**: Managers can perform all CRUD operations on Trucks, Employees, Branches, and Insurances. They can also mark trucks as returned after a customer returns them.
2. **Help Desk**: A support system for managing customer queries.
3. **Customer Operations**: Customers can rent trucks, make payments, manage their profiles, view old and active rentals, cancel or change rental details, and report issues.

The backend leverages Spring Boot for creating a robust and scalable server-side application and Spring Security for securing the application. The frontend, built with React, ensures a dynamic and responsive user experience. This combination of technologies provides a comprehensive solution for managing truck rentals effectively.
